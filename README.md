# RunRoute
A Java-based Android application that algorithmically creates routes for running/walking. The program creates routes using only walkable roads and paths.

To view the application code (MapsActivity.java), go to: app/src/main/java/com/example/runroute/MapsActivity.java

Doesn't currently have an active Google Satellite Data API key.

Necessary geographical data is downloaded as OSM data from OpenStreetMap/Kuopio, which is converted to GeoJSON.
