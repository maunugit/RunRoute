# RunRoute
A Java-based mobile application that algorithmically creates routes for running, based on geographical data.

To view the application code (MapsActivity.java), go to: app/src/main/java/com/example/runroute/MapsActivity.java

Doesn't currently have an active Google Satellite Data API key.

Necessary geographical data is downloaded from OpenStreetMap/Kuopio, converted to OSM data, which is finally converted to GeoJSON.
